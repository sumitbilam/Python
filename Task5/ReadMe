In this task I have shown how does simple class work in Python. I have used some getter and setter in the class to make it more simplified. 

Note that in Python, you actually relatively rarely use getters and setters. While these are required or strongly encouraged in some 
languages (like Java), they actually are often discouraged in Python in keeping with the "Pythonic" approach of keeping easy access to 
variables and data. Unless you are actually going to use one of the advantages associated with getters and setters, it may be best to skip
using them.

Still, it is important to know how they work for when you encounter them, and to know their advantages so you know when to use them.
